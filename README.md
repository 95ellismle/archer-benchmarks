# ARCHER Benchmarks

This repository contains the links, source code, build instructions and 
results from the ARCHER benchmark suite.

[ARCHER](http://www.archer.ac.uk) is the UK national supercomputing service
hosted, supported and adminstered by [EPCC](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk) at
the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk).

The benchmark suite contains both application and synthetic benchmarks.
The appplication benchmarks have been chosen with input from the user community
to represent the performance of their research that can exploit large 
scaling. The synthetic benchmarks have been chosen to provide an understanding
of the limits of performance of different components of the service.

## Synthetic Benchmarks

* [HPC Challenge (HPCC)](synth/HPCC)
* benchio

## Application Benchmarks

* [CASTEP](apps/CASTEP)
* [CP2K](apps/CP2K)
* [GROMACS](apps/GROMACS)
* [OpenSBLI](apps/OpenSBLI) 

If you have any questions about these benchmarks, please contact the
