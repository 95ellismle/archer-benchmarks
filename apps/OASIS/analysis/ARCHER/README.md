# Results for the HadGEM3-GC31_benchmark on ARCHER

* The timings are averaged over five runs Â± standard deviation.
* See ```coupled_run.job``` to understand how the total number of nodes is calculated depending on the UM and the nemo grid sizes.
  * We use two OpenMP threads per process for the UM-model.
  * We use eight XIOS processors.
 * We use the ```UM Run job``` start and end time from ```pe_output/atmos.fort6.pe0``` here, which is slighlty shorter than the overall run time for the batch script (about 6%).
