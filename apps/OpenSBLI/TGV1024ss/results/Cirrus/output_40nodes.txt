This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.
