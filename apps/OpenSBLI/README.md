## Overview

The benchmark test case setup using OpenSBLI is the Taylor-Green vortex problem in a cu- bic domain of length 2 Ï€. The code was setup to compute the validation, strong scaling and weak scaling simulations across architectures. The rest of the document explains setting up the various types of simulations, dependant libraries, compiling and running the simulation.
