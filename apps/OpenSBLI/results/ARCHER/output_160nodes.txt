This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some simulation information 
The simulation is performed is the strong scaling simulation 
The number of grid points used per direction are 1024
The total number of grid points are 1073741824

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

Some simulation information 
The simulation is performed is the strong scaling simulation 
The number of grid points used per direction are 1024
The total number of grid points are 1073741824

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

The simulation is performed is the strong scaling simulation 
The number of grid points used per direction are 1024
The total number of grid points are 1073741824

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.
