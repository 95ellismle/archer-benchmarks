This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

 =======The number of grid points used per direction are 512
The total number of grid points are 134217728
The simulation is performed is the strong scaling simulation 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

Some simulation information 
This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

 ==============================This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

 This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

 ----------------------------The number of grid points used per direction are 512
The total number of grid points are 134217728
This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.

This is the benchmark application developed for the CFD application of the 
UK HPC benchmark suite. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
on a Cartesian mesh using fourth order central finite difference scheme
and three stage Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.
