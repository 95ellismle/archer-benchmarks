GROMACS:      mdrun_mpi, version 2018.1
Executable:   /home/js947/rds/hpc-work/GROMACS/GromacsARCHERBench_master/build-icc/bin/mdrun_mpi
Data prefix:  /home/js947/rds/hpc-work/GROMACS/GromacsARCHERBench_master/gromacs-2018.1 (source tree)
Working dir:  /rds/user/js947/hpc-work/GROMACS/GromacsARCHERBench_master/r3/32
Command line:
  mdrun_mpi -s /home/js947/rds/hpc-work/GROMACS/GromacsARCHERBench_master/inputTPR/nsteps800.tpr -deffnm nc2-cubic-md -ntomp 1

Reading file /home/js947/rds/hpc-work/GROMACS/GromacsARCHERBench_master/inputTPR/nsteps800.tpr, VERSION 5.1 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 112
The number of OpenMP threads was set by environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1 (and the command-line setting agreed with that)
Multiple energy groups is not implemented for GPUs, falling back to the CPU. For better performance, run on the GPU without energy groups and then do gmx mdrun -rerun option on the trajectory with an energy group .tpr file.
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1.4 to 1.535


Will use 768 particle-particle and 256 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file

Using 1024 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun 'Protein in water'
800 steps,      1.6 ps.

step 200 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 8.3 %.


Writing final coordinates.

 Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 6.6%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 83%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 5.5%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.830
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 3.7 %

NOTE: 5.5 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.


NOTE: 39 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to use the -gcom option of mdrun
